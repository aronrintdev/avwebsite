                <h3>CAMILLE HEARST</h3>
                <p>
                    Camille believes that by leveraging all kinds of people, thoughts, ideas, opinions and backgrounds, we can help and learn from each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Camille co-founded KIT, a company that helps creators share products they love with their followers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kit was acquired in 2018 by Patreon, where Camille now serves as head of product. Patreon is the leading platform for creators to connect directly with their fans and followers.
